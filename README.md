# customer-segmentation-analysis

This repository contains code and analysis for a retail customer segmentation project. The project aims to analyze customer purchasing behavior and segment customers into distinct groups based on their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) attributes. By segmenting customers, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and services to specific customer segments, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**Methodology:**

**Data Preprocessing:** The data is cleaned to handle missing values, remove outliers, and ensure data quality.

**RFM Analysis:** Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values are calculated for each customer to understand their purchasing patterns.

**Clustering:** Clustering algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering are applied to segment customers based on their RFM attributes.

**Evaluation:** The performance of each clustering algorithm is evaluated using metrics such as silhouette score, elbow method, or dendrogram.

**Interpretation:** The characteristics of each customer segment are interpreted, providing actionable insights for marketing and business strategies.

**Expected Outcome:**

The expected outcome of this project is a set of well-defined customer segments with actionable insights for marketing and business strategies. By understanding the distinct needs and preferences of each segment, businesses can tailor their offerings and communication strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately leading to increased sales and profitability.
